<h1>Display left menu: grade condition</h1>

<p>By specifying a grade greater than 0, the user taking the lesson must have a grade equal to
or greater than the grade set in order to view the Left Menu.</p>
<p>This allows Lesson designers to force users to go through the entire lesson during the user's first attempt.
Then, if a user retakes the Lesson after meeting the required grade they can see the left menu to help with review.</p>
